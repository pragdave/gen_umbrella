# Umbrella

Create a basic umbrella project.

    $ mix gen umbrella «name»
    
To install this template:

    $ mix template.install hex gen_template_umbrella
    
(or you don't already have the template package install, you'll also
need to do:

    $ mix archive.install hex mix_templates
    $ mix archive.install hex mix_generator
    
this is a one-time thing).
